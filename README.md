# 🎓 Predicting Student Performance in Peru – PISA 2022 Analysis
ML models to predict student performance using PISA 2022 Peru dataset.
This project analyzes student performance in **Peru** using data from the **2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)**, released by the **OECD**. The goal is to predict students' scores in **Mathematics** and **Language** using a variety of machine learning models and compare their performance against classic regression methods.

> 📌 This project was completed as part of a **Big Data** course (worth 60% of the final grade) in the context of educational data analytics.


## 📚 Project Background

The **PISA study** evaluates 15-year-old students’ academic performance in mathematics, science, and reading across the globe. The 2022 wave includes data from **600,000 students** across 82 countries/economies.

This analysis focuses on **Peru** and uses various machine learning algorithms to understand what drives performance differences among students, leveraging both their responses and contextual variables.


## 🔍 Objectives

- Explore the structure and key variables in Peru's PISA 2022 dataset
- Use the mean of PV1–PV10 as the dependent variable for both **Math** and **Language** scores
- Train and evaluate multiple regression and tree-based models
- Compare performance using **training and testing MSE**
- Visualize and interpret which models best capture student performance patterns


## 🧠 Models Applied

### 📊 Linear Models
- **OLS Regression** (baseline)
- **Ridge Regression**
- **LASSO Regression**
- **Elastic Net Regression**

### 🌲 Tree-Based Models
- **Decision Tree**
- **Bagging**
